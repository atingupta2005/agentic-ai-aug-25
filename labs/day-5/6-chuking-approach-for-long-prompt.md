### Best Practices for Providing Long Prompts in Chunks

When you have a prompt that exceeds the model's context window (token limit), you need a strategy to manage the information flow. Here are some of the most effective methods, from simple to advanced:

#### 1. Sequential Context Building (The "Just Keep Talking" Method)
This is the most straightforward approach. You feed the model information piece by piece and explicitly tell it to wait for all the information before acting.

* **How it works:**
    1.  **Start with an instruction:** "I am going to provide you with a long document in several parts. Please just acknowledge each part by saying 'Received part X of Y. Ready for the next part.' Do not summarize or perform any tasks until I provide all the parts and give you the final instruction."
    2.  **Send your chunks:**
        * *User:* "Part 1: [Paste first chunk of text]"
        * *AI:* "Received part 1 of 5. Ready for the next part."
        * *User:* "Part 2: [Paste second chunk of text]"
        * *AI:* "Received part 2 of 5. Ready for the next part."
        * ...and so on.
    3.  **Provide the final instruction:** "I have now provided all 5 parts. Using the complete context from all the parts, please [your actual prompt/task here]."
* **Best for:** Tasks where the entire context must be considered "flat" and equally important, like summarizing a whole document or answering a question that requires synthesizing information from the beginning and end.
* **Limitation:** The model's short-term memory is still finite. For extremely long inputs, earlier parts might start to "fade" from its effective context, even if they are technically still in the conversation history.

#### 2. Summarization Cascade
This method compresses the information as you go, helping to keep the most important details within the active context window.

* **How it works:**
    1.  Send the first chunk. Ask for a detailed, structured summary.
    2.  For the second chunk, your prompt would be: "Here is the summary of the previous part: [Paste summary from step 1]. Now, here is the next part of the document: [Paste chunk 2]. Please provide an updated, combined summary of both parts."
    3.  Repeat this process, always feeding the next chunk along with the cumulative summary of everything that came before.
* **Best for:** Very long documents where you need to maintain a coherent "big picture" throughout. It's excellent for chapter-by-chapter book analysis or reviewing long reports.
* **Limitation:** You risk losing some granular details in the summarization process. The quality of the final output depends heavily on the quality of the intermediate summaries.

#### 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) - The Agentic Approach
This is the most robust and scalable method, and it's a cornerstone of modern Agentic AI. Instead of trying to fit everything into the prompt, you treat your long document as an external knowledge base.

* **How it works (Simplified):**
    1.  **Indexing:** You first break your entire document into smaller, logically coherent chunks (e.g., paragraphs or pages). You then use an embeddings model to convert each chunk into a numerical vector, which is stored in a special database (a vector database). This is a one-time, offline process.
    2.  **Querying:** When you want to ask a question, you take your question (e.g., "What were the key financial results in the Q3 report?") and convert it into a vector as well.
    3.  **Retrieval:** The system searches the vector database to find the text chunks whose vectors are most similar to your question's vector. These are the most relevant parts of your document.
    4.  **Generation:** The model is then given a much smaller, targeted prompt: "Using the following context: [Paste the few, highly relevant chunks retrieved from the database], please answer this question: [Your original question]."
* **Best for:** Almost everything, especially Q&A, research, and analysis over one or more large documents. It is the industry-standard solution to this problem.
* **Limitation:** Requires more setup (indexing, vector database).

### Implementing This in Agentic AI

An "agent" isn't just a single call to an LLM. It's a system that uses an LLM as its "brain" to reason and make decisions, but it also has **tools** and **memory**.

Hereâ€™s how the practices above map to an agentic workflow:

1.  **The Goal (The User's Initial Prompt):** "Analyze this massive codebase and identify potential security vulnerabilities." This is too big for a single prompt.

2.  **The Agent's Planner (The "Brain"):** The LLM receives this high-level goal. It reasons that the codebase is too large to fit in its context. Its internal monologue might be: *"The user's input is a large codebase. I cannot process it all at once. My best strategy is to use my Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) toolset to index the code and then query it for specific vulnerability types."*

3.  **The Agent's Tools (The "Hands"):** The agent has access to a set of functions (tools) it can call. To solve this problem, it would use:
    * `chunk_and_index_codebase(source_directory)`: This tool would implement the "Indexing" step of RAG described above. It reads all the code files, splits them into logical chunks (like functions or classes), gets their vector embeddings, and saves them to a vector database.
    * `search_codebase(query_string)`: This tool implements the "Retrieval" step. It takes a text query, finds the most relevant code chunks from the vector database, and returns them.

4.  **The Agent's Memory (The "Notepad"):** The vector database acts as the agent's long-term memory. The agent's reasoning process itself, where it keeps track of what it has already checked, is its short-term memory.

5.  **Execution Loop:**
    * **Step 1:** The Planner decides to start by looking for SQL injection vulnerabilities. It formulates a plan: "I will search for all code snippets related to database queries."
    * **Step 2:** It calls its tool: `relevant_code = search_codebase("SQL database query construction")`.
    * **Step 3:** The tool returns several relevant code snippets.
    * **Step 4:** The agent makes a standard LLM call *to itself*, but with a manageable amount of context: "Here are several code snippets related to database queries: [Paste retrieved snippets]. Analyze them for SQL injection vulnerabilities."
    * **Step 5:** The agent logs the results in its short-term memory ("Checked for SQL injection, found 2 potential issues.") and repeats the loop for the next vulnerability type (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting).
