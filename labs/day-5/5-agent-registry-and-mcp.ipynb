    "This example, while still simple, is a much more accurate model of a real agentic system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Clear Separation**: The `agent_registry.json` file is totally separate from the code. You can update the agent's description or version without touching the Python script.\n",
    "2.  **Formal Protocol (MCP)**: By forcing communication through `JSON strings`, we simulated a real API. The agent doesn't need to know *how* the tool works, and the tool doesn't need to know *who* is calling it. They just need to agree on the message format.\n",
    "3.  **Scalability**: To add a new \"Process Refund\" agent, you would simply:\n",
    "    * Add a new entry to the `agent_registry.json` file.\n",
    "    * Build a new `RefundAPITool` class that also \"speaks\" JSON.\n",
    "    * The core logic of the `SupportAgent` wouldn't need to change at all.\n",
