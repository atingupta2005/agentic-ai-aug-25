    "# üìù Lab: Automating Email Drafting with an AI Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you‚Äôll build an autonomous AI agent that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reads a client‚Äôs natural‚Äêlanguage query  \n",
    "- Drafts a professional email response using an LLM  \n",
    "- (Optionally) ‚Äúsends‚Äù the email via a stubbed API  \n",
    "- Maintains conversation context across queries  \n",
    "\n",
    "You‚Äôll use **LangChain** for orchestration, **OpenAI** as the LLM backend, and a simple in‚Äêmemory memory module.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up your Python environment and dependencies  \n",
    "2. Create a `draft_email` tool using an LLM  \n",
    "3. (Optional) Create a `send_email` stub tool  \n",
    "4. Assemble a LangChain agent that chooses between drafting and sending  \n",
    "5. Add conversation memory so follow‚Äêup drafts refer to earlier context  \n",
    "6. Test your agent in an interactive REPL  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python 3.8 or newer  \n",
    "- An OpenAI API key (export as `OPENAI_API_KEY`)  \n",
    "- Basic familiarity with Python and REST APIs  \n",
    "- (Optional) A SendGrid or SMTP account for real email sending  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create & activate** a virtual environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python -m venv venv\n",
    "   source venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux\n",
    "   venv\\Scripts\\activate           # Windows\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Install** required packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install langchain openai python-dotenv\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create** a file `.env` in your project root:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   echo \"OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXXXXX\" > .env\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create** `email_agent_lab.py` and add the following boilerplate:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import os\n",
    "   from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
    "\n",
    "   load_dotenv()\n",
    "   OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Implement the `draft_email` Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "This tool will prompt the LLM to generate a polished email based on a client request.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add** imports at the top of `email_agent_lab.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from langchain import Tool\n",
    "   from langchain.llms import OpenAI\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instantiate** the LLM:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   llm = OpenAI(\n",
    "       temperature=0.2,\n",
    "       openai_api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Define** the drafting function:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def draft_email(query: str) -> str:\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       query: natural‚Äêlanguage description of what the email should cover,\n",
    "       including recipient name, tone, and key points.\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       prompt = f\"\"\"\n",
    "       You are an expert business communicator.\n",
    "       Draft a professional email in response to the client request below.\n",
    "       \n",
    "       Client Request:\n",
    "       {query}\n",
    "       \n",
    "       Requirements:\n",
    "       - Use a polite, engaging tone.\n",
    "       - Include a subject line.\n",
    "       - Sign off with your name (e.g., ‚ÄúBest regards, [Your Name]‚Äù).\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       response = llm(prompt)\n",
    "       return response.strip()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Wrap** it as a LangChain `Tool`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   draft_email_tool = Tool(\n",
    "       name=\"draft_email\",\n",
    "       func=draft_email,\n",
    "       description=\"Draft a professional email based on a client query.\"\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Test** the tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "       sample = \"I‚Äôd like to introduce our new AI-driven analytics platform to Acme Corp‚Äôs CTO, Maria Gonzalez. Highlight features and request a demo.\"\n",
    "       print(draft_email(sample))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. (Optional) Implement the `send_email` Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate sending, we'll stub out an API call and print the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add** this function:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def send_email(payload: str) -> str:\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       payload: A JSON-like string containing \"to\", \"subject\", and \"body\".\n",
    "       In a real setup, replace this with an API call to SendGrid, SMTP, etc.\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       # Here, just print to console\n",
    "       print(\"=== Sending Email ===\")\n",
    "       print(payload)\n",
    "       return \"Email sent successfully (stub).\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wrap** as a `Tool`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   send_email_tool = Tool(\n",
    "       name=\"send_email\",\n",
    "       func=send_email,\n",
    "       description=\"Send an email given a structured payload.\"\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Assemble the AI Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "Use LangChain‚Äôs agent initializer to pick between `draft_email` and (optionally) `send_email`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Import** the initializer:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from langchain import initialize_agent, AgentType\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **List** your tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   tools = [draft_email_tool]\n",
    "   # If you implemented sending:\n",
    "   # tools = [draft_email_tool, send_email_tool]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialize** the agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   agent = initialize_agent(\n",
    "       tools=tools,\n",
    "       llm=llm,\n",
    "       agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,\n",
    "       verbose=True\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add** a REPL loop at the bottom of `email_agent_lab.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "       print(\"AI Email Agent ready. Type 'exit' to quit.\")\n",
    "       while True:\n",
    "           query = input(\"\\nClient Request: \")\n",
    "           if query.lower() == \"exit\":\n",
    "               break\n",
    "           # Agent decides which tool(s) to call\n",
    "           result = agent.run(query)\n",
    "           print(\"\\nAgent Response:\\n\")\n",
    "           print(result)\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "5. **Run** the agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   python email_agent_lab.py\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "   Thank you for considering our services for your website redesign. Below is a proposed timeline and budget outline:\n",
    "   ...\n",
    "   Best regards,\n",
    "   [Your Name]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Add Conversation Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "To allow your agent to remember previous drafts or context (e.g., client name), add a memory module.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install** embeddings support:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   pip install langchain[embeddings]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Import** and instantiate memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\n",
    "\n",
    "   memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key=\"chat_history\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reinitialize** your agent with memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   agent = initialize_agent(\n",
    "       tools=tools,\n",
    "       llm=llm,\n",
    "       agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,\n",
    "       memory=memory,\n",
    "       verbose=True\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Test** context carryover:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```text\n",
    "   Client Request: Draft an email to John from Acme introducing our AI service.\n",
    "   Agent: [drafts email]\n",
    "\n",
    "   Client Request: Ask him for his availability next week.\n",
    "   Agent: [drafts follow-up referencing John and Acme from memory]\n",
    "   ```\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Lab Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Source file `email_agent_lab.py` with:\n",
    "  - LLM initialization  \n",
    "  - `draft_email` (and optional `send_email`) tools  \n",
    "  - Agent setup with memory  \n",
    "  - REPL loop  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demonstration** logs or screenshots of:\n",
    "  - Drafting multiple emails in a session  \n",
    "  - Follow-up drafts leveraging memory  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Reflection Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does the agent choose which tool to invoke for a given query?  \n",
    "2. What prompts or prompt‚Äêtemplate changes improve draft quality?  \n",
    "3. How does memory influence follow‚Äêup drafts?  \n",
    "4. What real‚Äêworld security or compliance considerations arise when sending emails automatically?  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Next Steps & Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrate a real email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, SMTP).  \n",
    "- Add an **attachment** feature: upload files via agent tool.  \n",
    "- Implement **error handling** for API failures or bad prompts.  \n",
    "- Extend to a **multi-agent** system: one agent drafts, another proofreads.  \n",
    "- Deploy your agent as a web service using **FastAPI** or **Streamlit**.\n",
